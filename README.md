Your session will also inclue your list of current pokemon in your collection which can be updated through the pokedex. Unlike the games you can store more than 6 pokemon at a time so don't worry if you have more than 6 favorites! 

You are also able to create new pokemon with a name, move, and location if you can't find one of your favorites. If you made a typo or want to delete a pokemon you made, don't worry you can edit and delete any pokemon you create!
